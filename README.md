# python-challenge
Kenneth Le's python-challenge for Assignment 3

In this challenge I was given the task of analysing some data in a csv file using Python for 2 separate data sets.
I have followed the istructions to create and push files and folders from my local directory into GitHub and commited some of my files to upload.

For my script I used the activities that we worked on in class as a basis of my script and added some extra features that wer not covered from research from Googling. Any errors I came across I used a bit of AI to help me debug.
After the script runs it will output the results into the terminal and also created a text file with the results.
